<h1> Phylogenetic Trees </h1>

<p> This project is to construct an evolutionary tree of your chosen
species, using data from one of the standard gene banks and a standard
tool from bioinformatics. </p>

<h3> Dot plots </h3>

<p> We will consider the simplest form of sequence comparison:
pairwise dot plots of matching sub-sequences.  To see how this works,
let us consider the following strings. </p>

<pre>
x = "My care is loss of care, by old care done"
y = "Your care is gain of care, by new care won"
</pre>

<p> and then plot a dot whenever a region of five characters matches
between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.  We get the following. </p>

<a href="dotplot.png"><img height="300" src="dotplot.png"
                           alt="dot plot"/></a>

<p> We can see how the five-character
substring <code>"&nbsp;care"</code> produces a dot at
(<i>x</i>=2,<i>y</i>=4), and then more dots as it appears again. </p>

<p> Dot plots provide a convenient visual representation of the degree
of mismatch between sequences.  They also help understand sequence
alignment: an alignment is a path along a dot plot that optimizes some
measure of matching. </p>

<span class="prob">
Write a program to produce a similar dot plot.

<h3>Fetching genomes</h3>

<p> Input from the web is not limited to simple pages.  Here is an
example to fetch a protein sequence from <a href=
"http://www.uniprot.org">UniProt</a> and save it in a text file. </p>
<pre>
from Bio import ExPASy, SeqIO
sid = raw_input('Sequence id? ')
try:
    handle = ExPASy.get_sprot_raw(sid)
    seq = SeqIO.read(handle,'swiss')
    SeqIO.write(seq, sid+'.genbank','genbank')
    print 'Sequence length',len(seq)
except Exception:
    print 'Sequence not found'
</pre>
<p> By replacing <code>genbank</code> with <code>fasta</code> you can
change the output to FASTA format.  The sequence data are exactly the
same, of course, but the GenBank format has more meta-data about who
sequenced the gene and so on. </p>

<p> This example also illustrates Python's <code>try...except</code>
construction, which is useful for handling errors. </p>

<p class="prob">
The sequence id <code>F8RBX8</code> stands for the protein sequence of
an important gene in a well-known organism.  Fetch the data and save
it as a GenBank file.  Open the file using a text editor and read off the
gene name and organism.
</p>

</div>

<p> The method is easily applied to gene and protein sequences, we
just need to get a sequence into a string.  We already know how to
write a GenBank file with sequence data.  Let <code>fname</code> be a
string with the name of such a file, then try the following. </p>

<pre>
from Bio import SeqIO
f = open(fname)
p = SeqIO.parse(f,'genbank').next()
f.close()
print p.annotations['organism']
print p.seq
</pre>

<p> The sequence is now in the string <code>seq</code> and ready to be
analyzed. </p>

<h3> Phylogenetic trees </h3>

<p> We can try and infer the relationship between species from protein
sequences.  There are all sorts of statistical techniques one can use,
but simple examination already gives some clues.  We can type our
guessed relationship into a text file. </p>
<pre>
(((Human, Neandertal), Chimpanzee), (Cat, Lion))
</pre>
<p> called <code>tree.txt</code> (say).  This is the Newick format.
Then </p>
<pre>
from Bio import Phylo
tree = Phylo.read('tree.txt','newick')
tree.rooted = True
Phylo.draw(tree)
</pre>
<p> will draw a tree for us. </p>

<span class="prob">
<p>Choose a gene found in many species and make some dot plots comparing
the corresponding amino-acid sequence in different pairs of species.
Try and infer the phylogenetic relationships of a few species from the
dot plots, express it in Newick, and hence produce a phylogenetic
tree. </p>
</span>

<h3> NP-completeness </h3>

<p> Multiple sequence alignment is a famously hard problem. The
computer resources needed to guarantee finding the optimal alignment
grow like </p>

<p class="centered">
[Sequence length]<sup>[number of sequences]</sup>
</p>

<p> Basically, it is the product of all the sequence lengths.  As the
number of sequences increases, finding an optimal solution soon
becomes infeasible.  (Checking a proposed optimal alignment can,
however, be done more efficiently.)  Computational questions of such
complexity are said to be <i>NP-complete.</i>  Practical algorithms
aim to find a near-optimal solution, or to have a good (but not
perfect) chance of finding the optimal solution. </p>
